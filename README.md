NOTICE

This is an automated script with my personal combination of Fedora (specifically Silverblue) modifications I can not do without. This is not affiliated with RedHat or Fedora community.

NOTE

You may propose changes to the script but I only accept those that I consider useful for MYSELF. If you disagree with my notion of usefulness feel free to fork this project.
